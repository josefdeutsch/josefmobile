# JosephMobile - Digital art is true.

## Project Overview
Make Your App Material is the sixth project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.
A simple app that tells jokes. Building it bigger with Gradle. 

## Why this Project?
This project gives you the opportunity to learn the role of Gradle in building Android Apps and how to use
Gradle to manage apps of increasing complexity.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

* Add free and paid flavors to an app, and set up your build to share code between them
* Factor reusable functionality into a Java library
* Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library
* Configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app
* Use the Gradle App Engine plugin to deploy a backend
* Configure an integration test suite that runs against the local App Engine development server
