# JosephMobile - Digital art is true.

## Project Overview
Joseph is an Artproject consiting of two separete applications, josephMobile and josephTV.
Its goal is to provide my digital artworks to television.

## Why this Project?
I developed Joseph because I was looking for alternative ways to present my art.
During my work I was confronted more and more with the idea of digital space.
What exactly is digital space and how does it show itself?
The way to reinterpret an exhibition space captivates me and has motivated me so much to implement and complete joseph according to my ideas.
In the end, Joseph himself became a work of art and the metaphor: “The expression wanders through space” is the message that emanates from the heart of the matter.

## Joseph Artworks

## Project Overview:
The viewport shows a scenario of rotating sculpture on a mirror surface with variable graphic parameters.
The sculpture was modeled with Zbrush R.8 - "Dynamesh-Feature" and then exported as an OBJ with the "Triangulated Faces" mode.
A GLSL shader illuminates the surface that reflects an environment (environment mapping).
Below the sculpture there is a frame buffer that correctly interpolates the object. The mirror effect should serve as a constant reference to the viewer by reflecting the sculpture.
In order to guarantee effective accessibility of the individual parts, the scenario fades in and out.
